# Arduino_P2P_LedSerialController
This repository contains the code and resources for a peer-to-peer (P2P) LED control system using Arduino and serial communication. The project allows remote control of an LED connected to an Arduino board over a P2P network. It provides a seamless interface for users to send commands from a computer or mobile device to control the LED state.
